    <div class = "header2">Abstract</div>
    <div class = "par">With the continuous rise of the COVID-19 cases worldwide, it is imperative to ensure that all those vulnerable
       countries lacking vaccine resources can receive sufficient support to contain the risks. COVAX is such an initiative operated
        by the WHO to supply vaccines to the most needed countries. One critical problem faced by the COVAX is how to distribute the 
        limited amount of vaccines to these countries in the most efficient and equitable manner. This paper aims to address this 
        challenge by first proposing a data-driven risk assessment and prediction model and then developing a decision-making
         framework to support the strategic vaccine distribution. The machine learning-based risk prediction model characterizes how 
         the risk is influenced by the underlying essential factors, e.g., the vaccination level among the population in each COVAX 
         country. This predictive model is then leveraged to design the optimal vaccine distribution strategy that simultaneously 
         minimizes the resulting risks while maximizing the vaccination coverage in these countries targeted by COVAX. Finally, we 
         corroborate the proposed framework using case studies with real-world data.</div>

    <div class = "header2">Abstract</div>
    <div class = "par">Optimal transport (OT) is a framework that allows for optimal allocation of limited resources in a network 
      consisting of sources and targets. The standard OT paradigm does not extend over a large population of different types. In 
      this paper, we establish a new OT framework with a large and heterogeneous population of target nodes. The heterogeneity of
      targets is described by a type distribution function. We consider two instances in which the distribution is known and 
      unknown to the sources, i.e., transport designer. For the former case, we propose a fully distributed algorithm to obtain 
      the solution. For the latter case in which the targets’ type distribution is not available to the sources, we develop a 
      collaborative learning algorithm to compute the OT scheme efficiently. We evaluate the performance of the proposed learning 
      algorithm using a case study.</div>
